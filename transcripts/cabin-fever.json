    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "If ye grab some fuse from the gun locker, and a rope from the repair locker, then ye can use the rope on the sails." },

    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Yer not much of a pirate are ye lad?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye climb up the mast and use a rope on the sails up there." },

    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "I've been a pirate all me life and I've never heard anyone keep harpin' on like that!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Stop it!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "I warn ye, if the first word out of yer mouth is 'Arr' I'll be wearing yer spleen as a novelty hat!" },

    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "We call this magical process...repairin'." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye need to remove the old barrel, then replace it with a new one from the gun locker." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "And then what?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "I don't want to overload ye with too many details right now." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "If ye know what is good for ye, yer off to fix the cannon!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "By replacing the broken barrel with a new one! Hop to it, the salt air is clearly eatin' into yer brains!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Have ye sorted out the cannon yet?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Then hop to it lad!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye did? Great!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Now ye can give those pirates a good shot across their bows." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye'll need to load the cannon, and if ye get it wrong the barrel will blow." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "First, ye take some powder from the powder keg." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Then ye use a ramrod from the gun locker on the powder to tamp the charge." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Then ye use a canister round on the cannon." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Finally ye use some fuse on the cannon, and light it like ye did the fuse on the barrel earlier." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Then, ye'll need to use the ramrod on the cannon to clean it out for the next shot." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye got all that?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "And te think this was all I could get te help..." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "I can guess from the lack of an explosion that ye haven't fired the cannon yet, correct?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "And I'll bet ye want a quick recap of how to do it, correct?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye got all that this time?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Yer still not a pirate, so cut that out!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "We were on the home stretch lad why did we turn back?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Never mind, just go shoot the pirates and let's press on." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Aye?" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Three! Three times! Three! One more than two, one less than four! Got it!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Were almost there! Just hole their hull and we'll be able to make it past. Get to it!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye've done it! They're sunk now!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Let's head to the island!" },
    { "character": "Mama", "line": "Bill? You look like you've been to Davey Jones' locker and back." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Oh, Miss La'Fiette, if only I were that lucky." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "My crew deserted and I was stuck with an adventurer mannin' me ship." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "He was as piratical as a bunch of Dwellberries..." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Aye, I remember." },
    { "character": "Mama", "line": "I'll leave you two alone." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "All right..." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ok, yer now a pirate, but..." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "BUT ye can't just go around talking like some pirate in a fancy play." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "No self-respectin' pirate says 'Arr' that much!" },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Well, except for Fancy Dan, but that be another story." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Here, have this book. It'll learn ye how to be a pirate." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Or at least learn ye te talk proper like one." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Aye...that be all ye need te do." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Ye'll need that book if ye want te trade with some of the pirates round here." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Outsiders tend not te understand them if ye catch me drift." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Anyway, I'd have been shark bait without ye." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "If ye get a moment come see me fer yer share of the loot." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "I'm sure as soon as ye stop yellin' 'Arr!' ye'll make a great pirate." },
    { "character": "Bill Teach", "line": "Thanks. If ye need a lift back, just come see me." },
