    { "character": "Player", "line": "I am indeed. Just exploring the savannah." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "What do you do here?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "We're mostly here to keep an eye on the local animal populations, and provide animal parts to the city." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Current master?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "A hunter's work is dangerous. We tend to go through members faster than other guilds." },

    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "I'm not sure if you have the time or the patience, iknami, but a little birdy told me that our esteemed scribe Verity may require some assistance." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What sort of assistance?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "If I had to guess, she needs someone to find something for her." },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "She's a wonderful scribe, but can lose some strange things here and there." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Great! Point me in her direction and I'll get cracking!" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "She's behind the bar in the Burrow. Just look for the stressed woman trying to wrangle a bunch of barely-bathed hunters." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm not sure I have the time for that right now." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Are you free to talk about my quest?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Absolutely. Have you spoken to Verity yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, not quite yet." },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "If you're having a hard time finding her, she's behind the bar in the Burrow." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes please." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "So it's nice and simple. Just chat to any of the hunters in here to help them out." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Reports?" },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Indeed. There are all sorts of interesting creatures to hunt out there." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "If you do decide to take a job from any of the hunters, they'll tell you what type of creature they're looking into." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Once you've caught it, bring some proof back to the hunter that sent you out." },

    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Now, what else can I do for you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well actually, I heard there might be something I could help you with?" },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "You'll have to be slightly more specific. There's always something that needs doing down here!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Something a little birdy may have told Apatura?" },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Tetamo... Pitri needs to stop twittering with the birds. Yes, Gilman and I are concerned about Fox." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "He left quietly in the night, but we have no record of what he was doing." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you normally keep track of the hunters here?" },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "We try to, but it's like herding cats! We at least like to keep an eye on what they're hunting." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Could anyone else have put Fox onto a hunt?" },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "If anyone did, it would've been Wolf. She's always getting Fox into some kind of trouble." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll follow up with her then." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Have you spoken to Wolf yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. I'll have a chat to her now." },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Absolutely. So was our little birdy right about Verity needing a hand?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "They were... It wasn't an actual bird was it?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Of course not. Only Pitri talks to the birds." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "So, here to ask me what trouble I've gotten Fox into, are you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's not quite how I'd word it... but how did you know?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "I've honed my instincts over the years." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Well, that and the fact you had that whole conversation within earshot." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right... So did you send Fox out to do something?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Sort of. He's on some very unofficial business for me." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How unofficial?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "If I told you... I'd have to kill you!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Your face! Don't worry, I'm just pulling your leg." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "I asked him to look into making some repairs to Kiko's bed." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "It's been getting tatty lately. I'm guessing he didn't end up having the materials needed." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well then I guess the first step is to work out what he went to get." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Could I take a look at Kiko's bed?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "You're welcome to try, but you'll need to convince Kiko to let you." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "He's just by the table there." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Any advice for convincing him?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "He's very easy to distract. We have a little fake mouse we use sometimes." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Could I borrow it when I have a free hand to take it?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Sure thing." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Could I borrow it to have a go at distracting him?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Absolutely!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Have you checked Kiko's bed yet? It's just to the side of this table." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. Could I grab that mouse to distract him with?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Absolutely." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. I'll get to it now." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. Do you happen to have that mouse to distract him with?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "I already gave it to you. If you've lost it, you'll need to get another for yourself." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Kiko", "line": "Can you scratch my belly next? It's perfectly safe." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Kiko", "line": "Are you not going to wind it up first? Come on now, put some effort in." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Kiko", "line": "Do you mind? I'm trying to sleep here." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Here you go, little guy." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Kiko", "line": "A mouse? Fantastic!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Something attacked me in the dark... I can't move much..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Can I help you? Maybe patch you up?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "That would be much appreciated! There should be a couple of plants around to make a poultice..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "There should be a couple of plants around to make a... make a..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Stay with me, Fox! Where are these plants?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "It's a bit fuzzy... I've lost a lot of blood! One should be around here..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "...the other may be near the oasis... with the capybabas... haha, capybaras..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "And what am I making with them?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "A poultice! And hold it together with the tail from an embertailed jerboa." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Plants. Tail. Poultice. On it." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Don't forget... your traps for the jerboa... they're boxy..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "How's that poul... pool... poultice... Did you find the plants?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I think I've got them both." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "It doesn't look like you do... Who's the one with the head wound again?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where can I find them?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Absolutely. How's it going, iknami?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "We're getting there. I should have everything sorted very soon." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Fox has been injured out in the savannah!" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Well, that is impressive. How has he managed that?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He said he was attacked by an unknown assailant." },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Well as you're not offering your condolences, I can only assume he's survived?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He should be fine once I help him make a poultice for the wound." },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Excellent. A final question - was his hand injured?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Wonderful! Then I look forward to reading his report." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've found Fox. He's been injured by something out in the savannah." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Oh no... I should've offered to go with him." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "It's never sensible to be out after dark alone..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm going to do what I can to make sure he's okay." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Well thanks for checking in at least." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "He's still breathing and that's all Fox needs to come out on top." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Any updates on Fox?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He's been injured out in the savannah, but I'll do my best to make sure he makes it back." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Tetamo! Only he could get injured on an errand for a cat!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "I thought a little detour wouldn't hurt. I'd caught a glimpse of the most stunning pelt ever seen!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "As I was tracking it, I was attacked and knocked out. When I came to, it was gone." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Gone?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Without a trace, as well as most of my hunting equipment." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you think someone attacked you for it, or was it just an opportunist looting you?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "I was unconscious." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right, of course." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "You've already done me a huge favour, but I don't suppose I could ask for one more small one?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I suppose I could. Especially if it goes towards repairing that cat's bed." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Well it's your lucky day! Make some room and I'll give you the sample." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Well it's your lucky day! Take this sample to a woman called Atza in Outer Fortis." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where in the outskirts can I find her? And... what exactly do we need, again?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "She lives by the south western gate of the city." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "She'll be able to give us the matching fur to repair the cat's bed with." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Perfect! Here you go!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Any success with Atza yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not quite." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "If you're struggling to find her, she's in Outer Fortis, near the south western gate." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I appear to have lost the sample you gave me..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Luckily, I always come prepared. Here's a spare." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ah. It seems I don't have room for it." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Well I'm not going anywhere. Let me know when you do have room." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't suppose you've got another sample of Kiko's bed for me to take to Atza?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Fortunately for you, I'm always prepared..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "And our thief clearly didn't care for fine fur samples." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's convenient! Usually I'm the one that's always ready for these situations." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello again. I've given Atza the fur sample." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Did she give you the matching material?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. I should check back in with her." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hi there. You must be Atza. I heard you're the person to talk to about getting some material to match a sample?" },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "I might be. Depends who's asking... and what you're looking for, of course." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Your friend Fox was going to bring this sample to you, but he's been a little... waylaid." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Well, this wouldn't be the first time! Let's take a look." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't seem to have it with me." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "You'll have to go back to Fox and grab it then." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Here you go." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Good, good. Luckily for you, I recognise this fur." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "I do have a bit left, but I'll have to dig it out." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Shall I just wait here then?" },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Oh... Fox usually helps me with my chores when he visits." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's funny. He didn't mention that to me." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "That's alright, I'm sure a capable adventurer like you will manage fine." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Fox was going to assemble some equipment for me. You can manage that, can't you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I suppose so. Where do I start?" },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "It's all in that pile on the floor there. You can work it out, I'm sure." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Now, luckily for you, I recognise this fur." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Don't forget, I need a hand setting up that equipment on the floor!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Don't worry, I'm on it." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "So anyway, how did you come to be doing this for Fox?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, he actually got attacked on his way over here." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Shouldn't you be helping him heal up?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh he'll be alright. He was on the mend when I left him." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "All done!" },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Oh, that's looking much better." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Now that's done, did you manage to find the material?" },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Yes, I have it here." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Thanks for your help today. I hope that fur works for your project." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Yes, but you don't have enough room for it! Come back when you have space." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Could I get a replacement for that fur? I managed to lose it." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "You can, for now. I don't have an unlimited supply though, be careful." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "Ah, you don't have space for that." },
    { "character": "Atza", "line": "You should take that material back to Fox." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello again. I got the fur from Atza. She's certainly... something." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "She didn't make you do odd jobs for her, did she?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How did you know?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "She does it every time I visit!" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Now, I'll need you to take this report back to Verity." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "But it looks like you don't have space for it at the moment." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Anyway, now that's that, would you mind letting Wolf and Verity know I'm okay?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Oh, and can you take my report back to the guild?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Please apologise to Verity for the condition it's in." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "Oh, and of course, don't forget to use that fur along with another embertailed jerboa tail to fix Kiko's bed!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Want me to save the world while I'm at it?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "No need! You've already saved my world by making Kiko happy." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello there. Have you taken that report back to Verity yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. I still need to get around to it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've lost your report." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, that's just the adventuring way! If something isn't tied down, I'll grab it..." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "How is it you've lost the report and yet you somehow don't have space?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "You're lucky I don't have anywhere else to be." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Fox", "line": "I'll write you another one. Just a moment..." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Is that Fox's report? Thanks for bringing that back to us." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "How was he?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He's injured, but he's on the mend." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I expect he'll be back in here soon enough." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Good to hear. Once you're done with the cat's bed, you might want to check in with Guildmaster Apatura." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Thanks for all your help. Once you're done with the cat's bed, you might want to check in with Guildmaster Apatura." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll go and speak to her now." },
    { "character": "Guild Scribe Verity", "line": "Thanks for all your help. Have you checked in with the Guildmaster?" },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "How's the Fox situation?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Just about sorted. He'll be back here very soon." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Thank you, hunter." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He's doing well. He's got me doing a few things for him whilst he recuperates." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Ha! Now that's the Fox I know." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "I'll have to give him some odd jobs once he's back to make up." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Looks like the Fox situation is all sorted." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)", "line": "Thank you, hunter. I'm not sure I could have forgiven myself if something terrible had happened to him." },
    { "character": "Guild Hunter Kiko", "line": "Well as much as I resent the trickery used, this bed is much comfier now." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Everything's all wrapped up!" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "Kuani! So what was so important for our darling Kiko?" },
    { "character": "Guildmaster Apatura", "line": "...that poor Fox risked life and limb?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So, basically Wolf sent Fox to get fur to fix Kiko's bed, but he actually needed to talk to Atza..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "...and Atza needed me to..." },
