    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think he know." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "And?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "This polishing wheel..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "make thing shiny." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Looks like it's lost its soft edge then." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not my finest work, but I think it will do." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So when would we use the polishing wheel?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Polishing sword impotan... important." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Create perfect killing edge..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "very good for sword." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That makes sense." },

    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "but sometime hard say proppel... properly." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's alright, we'll figure it out together." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac agree. Ready to make sword?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes! I'm itching to get started." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac get few things ready first..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "then we can start." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay Kovac, I think I'm ready to make a sword." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac feel like things look correct..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think you are right." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what do I need to do to make a sword?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "First..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "you will need a coliti... commission." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where can I get one of those?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac will supply them..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac already gotten one from old friend." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay, so what do I need to make?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac need a Flat Broad sword." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Great!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How do I make that?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think we need to fill the..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "how's it called..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "the big stone bucket..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh, you mean a crucible?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Yes, thank you..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think we need to fill the crucible with metal first." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac has been connecti... collecting metals..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "They're in that box-crate by entry." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Use bars and weapons..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Crucible can take both." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Load metals into crucible until it looks full." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "While you do that..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think about next thing we need to do." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright, I've got the metal you said to take from the box. What now?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You will need to fill the crucible..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Add metals, armour or weapon you find to fill it." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "We stick to bronze and iron for this sword..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "We keep the first sword simple." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've added a few things to the crucible. Is that enough?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "No, we need more..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "28 metal bars worth. Weapon and armour can go into crucible too but some metal lost when melted down." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right, that's the crucible full. Can I make the sword yet?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think we need to set up a mould." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What's a mould used for?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac think mould will determine the type of sword to be made." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Remember, we need a Flat Broad sword." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay, so how do I go about setting up a mould?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac remember being told a sword is made from three parts..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "a forte, a blade and a tip." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Use mould jig behind you..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You can select part for each selecti... section." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Each mould part is differing..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "They will suit different commissions better..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Look for parts that match commission." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right... I think I'm with you." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "If you are still confused..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "come back to me." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm sorry Kovac, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm meant to be doing." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "That is okay..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac not so sure of himself..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "but you help Kovac, so Kovac help you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Thanks Kovac. You're gentle for a giant." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what was it I needed to do at the mould jig?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "We need to fill each part of the mould..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Forte, blade and tip." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "We want to use mould parts that match collisi... commission Kovac give you." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Remember, each part suit a differing sword better..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Look for ones that match Flat and Broad." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right, the mould is setup and the crucible is full to the brim. We must be ready to pour." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "let me look." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Yes, all things look correct..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Well done little one. We are ready." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Pour the metal from the crucible into the mould..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "then take out the preform." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Once you have done that..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac will tell how to work the preform." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "The metal's too hot to pick up!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What do I do?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Cool it down..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "What do you expect?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ah, of course... How do I do that?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac do not know. Try pouring water on it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm not sure what to do next..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "take the preform and put it in your hand. Then come see Kovac for help." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay Kovac, I've got this huge burning hot sword. What do I do with it?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Now for fun part." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Use tools around the foundry to reclin... refine the preform." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How do I know which tool I need to use?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac not too sure. Kovac's gut feeling says use trip hammer first." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "This is very impoten... important..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The preform needs to be within a certain heat range to work properly." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "If you use the wrong tool..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "or tool at wrong heat, we damage the preform quality." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "A sword with low quality is bad..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Means less giants will want it, so Kovac give less for it." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "If you damage a preform too much, it will become junk and Kovac will have to throw it away..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "but this first attent... attempt, so do not worry about quality too much." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You use trip hammer first. Trip hammer need preform to be quite hot." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "If the preform at wrong temperature..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You can hot it up by dunking it in lava or cold it by holding it to waterfall." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright, I'll give it a go." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Remember, try trip hammer first with hot preform." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm not sure which tool I need to use next." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Hmm... you need to use the trip hammer." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Make sure preform is nice and hot..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Trip hammer needs a high temperature." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Stop!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What did I do wrong?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You're damaging the preform!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the trip hammer." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh, my bad!" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Using wrong tool. We should be using the grindstone." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Using wrong tool. We should be using the trip hammer." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "time to move over to the grindstone." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The preform need to be warm..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Fictio... friction from grindstone will heat the preform up as well." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The sword is too hot. We need to cool it down to use it on the grindstone." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the grindstone." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Using wrong tool. We should be using the polishing wheel." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You are almost done..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "You just need to use polishing wheel to finish preform off." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Preform need to be quite cool to work with polishing wheel." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The sword is too hot. We need to cool it down to use it on the polishing wheel." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the polishing wheel." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Looks like the sword is finished. I should take it to Kovac." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I should finish helping Kovac before I try making another sword." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay Kovac, I think I've finally finished the sword!" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Hmm... let Kovac look." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "This is defeanin... definitely a sword..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Well done little one." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry it's not very good. I'm still getting use to everything." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "That is okay. You do better than Kovac could..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "We still leanin... learning." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what do we do with it now?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac take care of it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Out of curiosity, who is this first blade for?" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Kovac friend..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Obor." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Obor? Can't say I've heard of them." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Obor? He's just going to use it to kill me!" },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Obor good friend. Kovac know he only attack if you trespass his cave..." },
    { "character": "Kovac", "line": "Maybe you should have some manners and knock first." },
