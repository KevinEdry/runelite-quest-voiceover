    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "I'm sorry. It's just that I've lost her." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Lost who?" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Fluffs, poor Fluffs. She never hurt anyone." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Who's Fluffs?" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "My beloved feline friend Fluffs. She's been purring by my side for almost a decade. Please, could you go search for her while I look over the kids?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, I suppose I could." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Really? Thank you so much! I really have no idea where she could be!" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "I think my sons, Shilop and Wilough, saw the cat last. They'll be out in the market place." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright then, I'll see what I can do." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry, I'm too busy to play pet rescue." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Well, okay then. I'll have to find someone else." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Gertrude." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Have you seen my poor Fluffs?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm afraid not." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "What about Shilop?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No sign of him either." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Hmmm...strange, he should be at the market." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello there, I've been looking for you." },
    { "character": "Wilough/Shilop", "line": "I didn't mean to take it! I just forgot to pay." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What? I'm trying to help your mum find Fluffs." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "I might be able to help. Fluffs followed me to my secret play area, I haven't seen her since." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "Ohh...well, in that case I might be able to help. Fluffs followed me to my secret play area, I haven't seen her since." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where is this play area?" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "If I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Tell me sonny, or I will hurt you." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "W..wh..what?! Y..you wouldn't! A young lad like me! I'd have you behind bars before nightfall!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What will make you tell me?" },
    { "character": "Shilop", "line": "Well...now you ask, I am a bit short on cash." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How much?" },
    { "character": "Shilop", "line": "10 coins." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "10 coins?!" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "I'll handle this." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "100 coins should cover it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "100 coins! Why should I pay you?" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "You shouldn't, but we won't help otherwise. We never liked that cat anyway, so what do you say?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm not paying you a penny." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "Okay then, I'll find another way to make money." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay then, I'll pay." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "There you go, now where did you see Fluffs?" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "I play at an abandoned lumber mill to the north east. Just beyond the Jolly Boar Inn. I saw Fluffs running around in there." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Anything else?" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "Well, you'll have to find the broken fence to get in. I'm sure you can manage that." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, never mind, it's Fluffs' loss." },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "I'm sure my mum will get over it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where did you say you saw Fluffs?" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "Weren't you listening? I saw the flea bag in the old lumber mill just north east of here. Just walk past the Jolly Boar Inn and you should find it." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Hello again, did you manage to find Shilop? I can't keep an eye on him for the life of me." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He does seem quite a handful." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "You have no idea! Did he help at all?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I think so, I'm just going to look now." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Thanks again, adventurer." },
    { "character": "Fluffs' kitten", "line": "Mew!" },

    { "character": "Fluffs", "line": "Mew!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello again." },
    { "character": "Shilop", "line": "You think you're tough do you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Pardon?" },
    { "character": "Shilop", "line": "I can beat anyone up!" },
    { "character": "Wilough", "line": "He can you know!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Really?" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Hello. How's it going? Any luck?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes, I've found Fluffs!" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Well well, you are clever! Did you bring her back?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, that's the thing, she refuses to leave." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Oh dear, oh dear! Maybe she's just hungry. She loves doogle sardines but I'm all out." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Doogle sardines?" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Yes, raw sardines seasoned with doogle leaves. Unfortunately I've used all my doogle leaves, but you may find some in the woods out back." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hi!" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Hey traveller, did Fluffs eat the sardines?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yeah, she loved them, but she still won't leave." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Well that is strange, there must be a reason." },
    { "character": "Fluffs", "line": "Purr..." },
    { "character": "Fluffs' kitten", "line": "Purr..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Gertrude. Fluffs ran off with her kitten." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "You're back! Thank you! Thank you! Fluffs just came back! I think she was just upset as she couldn't find her kitten." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "If you hadn't found her kitten it would have died out there!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's okay, I like to do my bit." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "I don't know how to thank you. I have no real material possessions. I do have kittens! I can only really look after one." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, if it needs a home." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "I would sell it to my cousin in West Ardougne. I hear there's a rat epidemic there. But it's too far." },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Here you go, look after her and thank you again!" },
    { "character": "Gertrude", "line": "Oh by the way, the kitten can live in your backpack, but to make it grow you must take it out and feed and stroke it often." }
