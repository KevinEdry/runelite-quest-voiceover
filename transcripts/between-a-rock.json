    {"character": "Player", "line": "Hello!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "What?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I said hello!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Hello!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Who are you?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Why, I'm Dondakan, of course!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Why are you firing a cannon at a wall?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "It's not a wall! It's a rock!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What's the difference?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "It's a very special rock!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I still don't quite follow..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Oh, for Guthix' sake, it's perfectly simple! See, that rock over there, it's impenetrable!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Have you tried taking a pickaxe to it?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Of course I have, I'm holding this rune pickaxe, aren't I? We've been trying to mine through it for years!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "We? I don't see anyone else."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Well, I'm the only one left... all the others gave up. Said it wasn't worth their while anymore."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Isn't there?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "At first we thought there might be a huge treasure behind the rock, you see."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Until we had a look further down the stream, around the rock... no, there's no treasure there, just a dead end."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Okay... so why were you trying to get through the rock again?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Because obviously there are vast deposits of minerals inside the rock! And if not, I want to harness the extreme hardness of the rock itself!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "The only problem is that I have run out of ideas on how to do it."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Perhaps a young adventurer like you is willing to help out an old dwarf like me? Want to find out what's inside the rock?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Sure, sounds interesting!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Welcome aboard then!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No thanks, I do enough mining on my own."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Cozy? No, not really, it's damp and cold!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Bit noisy here, isn't it?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Then stop shouting!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No! I said it's noisy!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Goodbye!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Any idea on what's inside the rock?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "No, but that's where you come in!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I want you to find out some more information on the rock."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "How so?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I don't know! Wish I knew!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "But we have to get some better understanding of what this thing actually is. Maybe then we can find a way to break it open."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Now where would I do that?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "And what are you going to do while I go running across half of Gielinor, I'll wager?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I'll guard my cannon and fire more cannonballs at it, of course! Wish I had your job, mine's a tough one!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Want to trade places?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "My legs are too old and worn to do much running around anymore, I'm afraid."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Well, off you go now! Start running, start talking!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "But I still don't know where!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Oh, why so difficult?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Look, try the city, further down the stream here. There's bound to be someone there who knows something. If you still can't find anyone, go to the librarian, he knows a lot."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What did you need me to do?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I'll be back later."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What do you know about impenetrable rocks?"},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "Welcome to the Keldagrim library, human traveller!"},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "You're confusing me, what rock exactly are you talking about?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "The big one in the mines south of the city. Dondakan's big rock."},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "I see, I see."},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "But I don't know much about that rock, I'm afraid. It's baffled us for many generations."},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "There is a dwarf in the mechanics shop, though, who I believe has some connections with a certain scholar."},
    {"character": "Librarian", "line": "Go south to the palace, the shop is called Wemund's Wrench Warehouse. He should be working there somewhere."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Thanks!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Do you know anything about this rock in the mines?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Now what rock would that be, exactly?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "The big rock in the mines to the south, with an old dwarf standing beside it..?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Ah, Don's rock, right?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Er, yes, I think so. Do you know what it's made of?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "No, no one knows. No one here, anyway. The only one I can think of is Rolad, a renowned scholar."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "He left to explore the world. Learning by experience, or so he said. Me, I prefer a cold stout at home, but it takes all sorts."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "So where can I find this Rolad?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "I think he's currently with the Black Guard at Ice Mountain."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Great, thanks a lot!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Excuse me... would you happen to be Rolad the scholar?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Why, yes, I think so... who's asking?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "It's this rock that Dondakan is trying to break open. You know Dondakan, right?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "You're awfully tall for a dwarf, you know. And a rock you say? I suppose I know a fair bit about rocks, yes."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh, old Dondakan, sure I know him. And I know his rock too. It's that unbreakable one, isn't it?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Yes, that's the one. What can you tell me about it?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Well, as a matter of fact, I picked up an interesting book on one of my travels, from a quite out of the way dwarven outpost."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I'm not entirely sure, but it seems to describe this very rock, and how it came to be placed in that cavern."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I tore out the most interesting pages for more detailed perusal. Let me get them for you."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh dear..."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What's wrong?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I seem to have misplaced the pages... a pity, I had wanted to study them some more. Oh well..."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What? No! I need that book!"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh, well, if it's that important to you, perhaps you can go and look for the pages? There should be three of them."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Where should I start looking?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I probably lost them in the mines below. I don't have them up here in any case."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What, in the mining guild?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "No no, I never go there, I'm not a member you know. But I sometimes go down to the regular mines to study the conditions of the working dwarf."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Okay, thanks, I'll go and look for the pages then."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Rolad has a book that might help us!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Well, that's the problem... the most important pages are missing."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "How are you getting on with finding those missing pages?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I haven't found a single one yet, I have no idea where I should be looking."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Well, I found the first page, but I still have two to go."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I found two of the pages! But I haven't found the last one yet."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Look, I found all of your missing pages!"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Why, yes, have you read it yet?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Yes, the missing pages of that book we were talking about earlier?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Well, here, I happened to have a copy of it. Try not to lose it this time!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Of course, I'd be happy to!"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I suppose I just forgot that I had one."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Of course... when I've finished with it I'll give it back to you, sure..."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh yes, have you read it yet?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Why, naturally, that's no problem for someone with such a keen interest in expanding knowledge!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "That was quite an interesting book you gave me."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Yes, but I'd like to hang on to it a little longer, if I may."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I have that golden cannonball you asked me to make."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "That... that... that's an amazing looking cannonball!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Are you sure you want me to fire it at the rock?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Yes, I'm sure this will crack open the rock."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "It breaks my heart to ruin such a fine piece of crafting."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Did... did... did you see that?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "The cannonball went right through it!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I don't believe it! All this time, I've been spending all my gold."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "But... the rock didn't actually break, did it?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "No, it seemed more like it... gave way for a second."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "So how does this help us?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Why, I'll just shoot you through it so you can have a look."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Shoot me... through it? Errr... what exactly do you mean?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Very simple. I'll have to make a few modifications to my cannon."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Then I'll fire you at the rock so you can do reconnaissance."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Might want to pick up that cannonball again while you're at it!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "But... what if I bump into that demon, the one from the book?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Don't be silly now. It's just a rock... just a rock with gold."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "So you want to... fire me into the rock?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Yes, just to see what's inside... to see if all that gold."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Are you sure that it's safe?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "No, but then we'll never know until we've tried it, right?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Find someone else for your bizarre experiment!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "But we're so close to all that gold!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I can't argue with that, shoot me in!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Well, it's not so simple... like I said, I need to make."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Okay, I'll just wait right here until you've made them."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I don't really know how, actually."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Okay, so you want me to look for the schematics for you?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "That's it, yes! Here, I have one part of the schematics."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "You'll have to find the rest on your own."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Oh, and you'll also need a golden helmet of course."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Won't a gold plated helmet do?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "No, it has to be a helmet made out of solid gold."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Unless you want to die when I shoot you at the rock?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No no, I'll get you a helmet made out of solid gold."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Although that will be a horrendously heavy thing to wear."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Yes yes, well, get going now, why don't you?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "That's what I thought you'd say."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What did you want me to find again?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Schematics to modify my cannon, and a golden helmet."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I lost that schematic you gave me, actually."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Oh, be more careful! Here, have a copy."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Sounds simple enough. Any idea on where I can find those?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Not a clue! I don't even know how many parts there are."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "It's probably best to ask any dwarven engineers."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Didn't you talk to someone in Keldagrim already?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Again..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "No complaining now, run along!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I'm looking for schematics to modify the dwarven multicannon."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Haha, yesh, I have jusht the shing!"},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "I've been working on thish deshign for quite a while."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Never got to test it, love to shee it shoot a real human!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Well, can you give them to me? I'd be willing to try."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Oooh, shure, shure... I've only got one part left."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Who did you give them to?"},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "How should I know? I'm only a shimple dwarf."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Okay, okay, can I have that one schematic then?"},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Of courshe!"},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Just give me a drink and I'll gladly help you."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No, I've had enough of buying drinks for people!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "It's always like this... Sure, I'll help you, just get me."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "And more often than not they actually want a special drink."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "And what is wrong with all you people anyway?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Sometimes it seems as if half the population are alcoholics!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "So, no, I won't do it anymore, you can get your own drink."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Pffft, I only wanted a dwarven shtout from that table."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Here, have the shtupid schematic, I've gone right off."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Oh, alright, what do you want to drink?"},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Oooh, jusht a glash of dwarven shtout over there..."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Here, I've got your dwarven stout."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "That'sh wonderful! You're a good human, you are."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Here, have thish schematic and have fun with it!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Thanks for that schematic."},
    {"character": "Khorvak, a dwarven engineer", "line": "Sho have you been shot out of a cannon yet?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No, fortunately not."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "You've been so helpful with that book, I was wondering."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Can you help me with something else as well?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Of course, anything to help a fellow dwarf."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Dondakan wants to modify his multicannon, you see."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "To fire a human."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "A human, you say? Are we using humans as cannon fodder?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Well, good for him, never did like humans anyway."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "But can you help me with the schematics?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Dondakan needs to know what he needs to modify."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh, I see, I see. No, I have no schematics."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "All I have are the base schematics of the cannon."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I was on the multicannon project once, you know?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Oh, those will be a tremendous help already."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Can I borrow those off of you as well?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Well, of course, I have the schematics written on paper."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Let me just look for it."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh dear, I seem to have lost the schematics."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "You are rather a forgetful person, aren't you?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "I hardly ever lose anything, I'll have you know!"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Now, you wouldn't be able to go look for the schematics?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Oh, alright, I'll go and have a look."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Say, you wouldn't happen to have another copy of book?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Don't tell me you lost that book!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Er, yes, I lost your book..."},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Lucky that I have another copy, isn't it?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Please don't lose it again."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Great, thanks a lot!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I can't seem to find your schematics..."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Did you lose them down in the mines again?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh, let's see... well... maybe. I'm not altogether sure."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "No idea at all?"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Sorry, no... I do not even remember what I drew."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I found your schematics! You wrote them on that book!"},
    {"character": "Rolad", "line": "Oh, of course, why didn't I think of that!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Do you have any schematics related to the dwarven multicannon?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Why, what do you need them for?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Ah, so you do!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Dondakan needs schematics to modify his multicannon."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "To fire a human you see."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "And you'd be the test subject? I mean, the cannonball?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Ehm, yes, I suppose so..."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Haha, that I would like to see!"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Here, take this. Khorvak sent it to me from White Wolf."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Kind of as a joke. It's incomplete, of course."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Doesn't mean anything without other parts."},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Haha, he's always a laugh, that Khorvak."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Thanks... I suppose."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Do you have any schematics related to the dwarven multicannon?"},
    {"character": "Dwarven Engineer", "line": "Yes, and I already gave a part to you, remember?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Oh yes."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I think I have all the different parts of the schematics..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Let me have a look at that!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "This doesn't make any sense, it's all jumbled up!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Sort it out, will you, don't torment an old dwarf."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I have that golden helmet you said I'd need."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What else did you need again?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "I still need those schematics to modify my cannon."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "It doesn't normally fire humans, you know."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I've got your schematics... what else was I supposed to do?"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "You'll need a golden helmet as well."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "If you want to survive the blast."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I would prefer that, yes."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I've got your schematics all assembled."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "And I have that golden helmet as well!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Well, go ahead and wear your helmet!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Won't protect your head if it's not on your head!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Wonderful! These schematics look simple enough..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Are you ready for your quick trip through the rock?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "You may fire when ready!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Ah, such enthusiasm! Okay, here we go."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Let me have a look at those schematics."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Right, sitting comfortably?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Er, not really, no..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Excellent, excellent, I'll get the cannon ready."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I'm starting to get second thoughts about this!"},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Just think of all that gold!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I'm thinking of that demon..."},
    {"character": "Dondakan the Dwarf", "line": "Don't worry, it'll all be over in a moment!"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "That's what I'm afraid of."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Where... where am I?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "What is this place?"},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "Dondakan said there was supposed to be a river."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "But I don't see a river here."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "I think... I think... I think I may be..."},
    {"character": "Player", "line": "...inside the rock!"},
    {"character": "Arzinian Being of Bordanzan", "line": "You are in my domain now!"},
