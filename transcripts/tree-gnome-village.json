    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "I'm surprised you made it in, maybe I made the maze too easy." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Maybe." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "I'm afraid I have more serious concerns at the moment. Very serious." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Can I help at all?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "I'm glad you asked." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "The truth is my people are in grave danger. We have always been protected by the Spirit Tree. No creature of dark can harm us while its three orbs are in place." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "We are not a violent race, but we fight when we must. Many gnomes have fallen battling the dark forces of Khazard to the North." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "We became desperate, so we took one orb of protection to the battlefield. It was a foolish move." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Khazard troops seized the orb. Now we are completely defenceless." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How can I help?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "You would be a huge benefit on the battlefield. If you would go there and try to retrieve the orb, my people and I will be forever grateful." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I would be glad to help." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Thank you. The battlefield is to the north of the maze. Commander Montai will inform you of their current situation." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "That is if he's still alive." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "My assistant shall guide you out. Good luck friend, try your best to return the orb" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "We're out of the maze now. Please hurry, we must have the orb if we are to survive." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm sorry but I won't be involved." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Ok then, travel safe." },

    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Ok, take care." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Elkoy." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Oh my! Oh my!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What's wrong?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "The orb, they have the orb. We're doomed. Do you need me to show you through the maze?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes please." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Please help us get our orb back." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not now, thanks." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "The orb, they have the orb. We're doomed. Do you need me to show you back to the village?" },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "Oh my, oh my!" },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "The orb, they have the orb. It must be returned or we're doomed." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello, how are you?" },
    { "character": "Kalron", "line": "Oh my. I'll never find my way back before Khazard's men come and hunt me down." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Bolren." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Hello traveller, we must retrieve the orb. It's being held by Khazard troops north of here." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll try my best." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "The orb is being held at the battlefield north of the maze." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Hello traveller, are you here to help or just to watch?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've been sent by King Bolren to retrieve the orb of protection." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Excellent we need all the help we can get." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I'm commander Montai. The orb is in the Khazard stronghold to the north, but until we weaken their defences we can't get close." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What can I do?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Firstly we need to strengthen our own defences. We desperately need wood to make more battlements, once the battlements are gone it's all over. Six loads of normal logs should do it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry I no longer want to be involved." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "That's a shame, we could have done with your help." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll gather some wood." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Please be as quick as you can, I don't know how much longer we can hold out." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "I can't talk now. Can't you see we're trying to win a battle here?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hi there." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "The battle is far from over. If you have a pure heart you will help us win." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "I can't stand this war. The misery, the pain, it's driving me crazy! When will it end?" },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "Don't speak to me you insignificant wretch! Die in the name of Khazard!" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "You must retrieve the orb, or the gnome village is doomed. Do you need me to show you through the maze?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Hello again, we're still desperate for wood soldier. We need six loads of normal logs." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll see what I can do." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Thank you." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Hello again, we're still desperate for wood soldier." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have some here. (You give six loads of logs to the commander.)" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "That's excellent, now we can make more defensive battlements.  Give me a moment to organise the troops and then come speak to me. I'll inform you of our next phase of attack." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How are you doing Montai?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "We're hanging in there soldier. For the next phase of our attack we need to breach their stronghold." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "The ballista can break through the stronghold wall, and then we can advance and seize back the orb." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what's the problem?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "From this distance we can't get an accurate enough shot.  We need the correct coordinates of the stronghold for a direct hit.  I've sent out three tracker gnomes to gather them." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Have they returned?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I'm afraid not, and we're running out of time. I need you to go into the heart of the battlefield, find the trackers, and bring back the coordinates." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Do you think you can do it?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, I've had enough of your battle." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I understand, this isn't your fight." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll try my best." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Thank you, you're braver than most." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I don't know how long I will be able to hold out. Once you have the coordinates come back and fire the ballista right into those monsters." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "If you can retrieve the orb and bring safety back to my people, none of the blood spilled on this field will be in vain." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Hello warrior. We need the coordinates for a direct hit from the ballista. Once you have a direct hit you will be able to enter the stronghold and retrieve the orb." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you know the coordinates of the Khazard stronghold?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "I managed to get one, although it wasn't easy." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well done." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "The other two tracker gnomes should have the other coordinates if they're still alive." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "OK, take care." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Are you OK?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "They caught me spying on the stronghold. They beat and tortured me." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "But I didn't crack. I told them nothing. They can't break me!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm sorry little man." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "Don't be. I have the position of the stronghold!" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "Now leave before they find you and all is lost." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hang in there." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "Go!" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "OK? Who's OK? Not me! Hee hee!" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "You can't see me, no one can. Monsters, demons, they're all around me!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What do you mean?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "They're dancing, all of them, hee hee." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you have the coordinate for the Khazard stronghold?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "Who holds the stronghold?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "Less than my hands." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "More than my head, less than my fingers." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "More than we, less than our feet." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "My legs and your legs, ha ha ha!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "You're mad." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "Dance with me, and Khazard's men are beat." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll pray for you little man." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "All day we pray in the hay, hee hee." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That tracker gnome was a bit vague about the x coordinate! What could it be?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Evidently that wasn't the right x coordinate." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've breached the stronghold." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I saw, that was a beautiful sight. The Khazard troops didn't know what hit them." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Now is the time to retrieve the orb. It's all in your hands. I'll be praying for you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello again." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "Well done, you've broken down their defences. This battle must be ours." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "Well done, you've broken down their defences. This battle must be ours." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "Don't talk to me, you can't see me. No one can, just the demons." },
    { "character": "Khazard commander", "line": "Don't even think of taking the orb!" },
    { "character": "Khazard commander", "line": "Oi! You! Get out of there." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have the orb of protection." },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "Incredible, for a human you really are something." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Thanks... I think!" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I'll stay here with my troops and try and hold Khazard's men back. You return the orb to the gnome village. Go as quick as you can, the village is still unprotected." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How are you tracker?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "Now we have the orb I'm much better. They won't stand a chance without it." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "Now we have the orb I'm much better. Soon my comrades will come and free me." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "You're back! And the orb?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, I'm afraid not." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive. Do you need me to show you through the maze?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Remsai." },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "Hello, did you find the orb?" },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "No thanks Elkoy." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Elkoy. I have the orb." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Can you show me out of the village?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Please return with our orb soon." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay." },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "You're our saviour." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello little man." },
    { "character": "Local Gnome", "line": "Little man stronger than big man. Hee hee, lardi dee, lardi da." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Amazing, you recovered the orb." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Well I am impressed. Would you like to buy something?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have the orb." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Oh my... The misery, the horror!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "King Bolren, are you OK?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Thank you traveller, but it's too late. We're all doomed." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What happened?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "They came in the night. I don't know how many, but enough." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Who?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Khazard troops. They slaughtered anyone who got in their way. Women, children, my wife." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm sorry." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "They took the other orbs, now we are defenceless." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where did they take them?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "They headed north of the stronghold. A warlord carries the orbs." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I will find the warlord and bring back the orbs." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "You are brave, but this task will be tough even for you. I wish you the best of luck. Once again you are our only hope." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "I will safeguard this orb and pray for your safe return. My assistant will guide you out." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Good luck friend." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm sorry but I can't help" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "I understand, this isn't your battle." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Did you hear?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Khazard's men have pillaged the village! They slaughtered many, and took the other orbs in an attempt to lead us out of the maze. When will the misery end?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Please help us find the orbs." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm very sorry." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Would you like me to show you the way to the village?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Here we are. Despite what has happened here, I hope you feel welcome." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Ok then, take care." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Are you ok?" },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "Khazard's men came. Without the orb we were defenceless. They killed many and then took our last hope, the other orbs." },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "Now surely we're all doomed. Without them the spirit tree is useless." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello there." },
    { "character": "Kalron", "line": "Oh my, oh my, the village has been pillaged and I'm still lost. Oh dear." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hi." },
    { "character": "Local Gnome", "line": "Must save the orbs and kill the Khazard warlord. That will be fun, hee hee." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello Montai, how are you?" },
    { "character": "Commander Montai", "line": "I'm ok, this battle is going to take longer to win than I expected. The Khazard troops won't give up even without the orb." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Oh, hello there. Have you heard? They took the other orbs, it's terrible. I suppose the show must go on." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Would you like to buy something?" },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 1", "line": "When will this battle end? I feel like I've been fighting forever." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 2", "line": "When will this battle end? I feel like I've been locked up my whole life." },
    { "character": "Tracker gnome 3", "line": "I feel dizzy, where am I? Oh dear, oh dear I need some rest." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I think you do." },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "You think you're so clever. You know nothing!" },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "I'll crush you and those pesky little green men!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "You there, stop!" },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "Go back to your pesky little green friends." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've come for the orbs." },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "You're out of your depth traveller. These orbs are part of a much larger picture." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "They're stolen goods, now give them here!" },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "Ha, you really think you stand a chance? I'll crush you." },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "Bah, enough of you!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I thought I killed you?" },
    { "character": "Khazard warlord", "line": "Fool, warriors blessed by Khazard don't die. You can't kill that which is already dead. However I can kill you!" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "You truly are a hero." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Thanks." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "You saved us by returning the orbs of protection. I'm humbled and wish you well." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Would you like me to show you the way to the village?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Here we are. Feel free to have a look around." },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "You saved us by returning the orbs of protection. I'm humbled and wish you well. Would you like me to show you through the maze?" },
    { "character": "Elkoy", "line": "Here we are. Have a safe journey." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've returned." },
    { "character": "Remsai", "line": "You're back, well done brave adventurer. Now the orbs are safe we can perform the ritual for the spirit tree. We can live in peace once again." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello gnome." },
    { "character": "Local Gnome", "line": "Soon we're gonna have the sacred ceremony and boy am I going to party. Lock up your daughters. Hee hee." },
    { "character": "Kalron", "line": "Hello. I hope they come out and find me soon. It's getting cold." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Hello there. You're that hero who saved the orbs. Soon we will perform the ritual and the village will be safe again." },
    { "character": "Bolkoy", "line": "Anyway, would you like anything from my shop?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Bolren, I have returned." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "You made it back! Do you have the orbs?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Please, we must have the orbs if we are to survive." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have them here." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Hooray, you're amazing. I didn't think it was possible but you've saved us." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Once the orbs are replaced we will be safe once more. We must begin the ceremony immediately." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What does the ceremony involve?" },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "The spirit tree has looked over us for centuries. Now we must pay our respects." },

    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "Please, for your efforts take this amulet. It's made from the same sacred stone as the orbs of protection. It will help keep you safe on your journeys." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Thank you King Bolren." },
    { "character": "King Bolren", "line": "The tree has many other powers, some of which I cannot reveal. As a friend of the gnome people, I can now allow you to use the tree's magic to teleport to other trees grown from related seeds." }
