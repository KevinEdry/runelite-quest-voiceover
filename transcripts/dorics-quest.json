    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Hello traveller, what brings you to my humble smithy?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I wanted to use your anvils." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "My anvils get enough work with my own use. I make pickaxes, and it takes a lot of hard work. If you could get me some more materials, then I could let you use them." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes, I will get you the materials." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Clay is what I use more than anything, to make casts. Could you get me 6 clay, 4 copper ore, and 2 iron ore, please? I could pay a little, and let you use my anvils. Take this pickaxe with you just in case you need it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where can I find those?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "You'll be able to find all those ores in the rocks just inside the Dwarven Mine. Head east from here and you'll find the entrance in the side of Ice Mountain." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "But I'm not a good enough miner to get iron ore." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Oh well, you could practice mining until you can. Can't beat a bit of mining - it's a useful skill. Failing that, you might be able to find a more experienced adventurer to buy the iron ore off." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Certainly, I'll be right back!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "You know, it's funny you should require those exact things!" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "What do you mean?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I can usually fit 28 things in my backpack and in a world full of quite literally limitless possibilities, a complete coincidence has occurred!" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "I don't quite understand what you're saying?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, out of pure coincidence, despite definitely not knowing what you were about to request, I just so happened to have carried those exact items!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "In fact, in the exact quantities too!" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Oh my, that is a coincidence! Pass them here, please. I can spare you some coins for your trouble, and please use my anvils any time you want." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, hitting rocks is for the boring people, sorry." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "That is your choice. Nice to meet you anyway." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I wanted to use your whetstone." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "The whetstone is for more advanced smithing, but I could let you use it as well as my anvils if you could get me some more materials." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Mind your own business, shortstuff!" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "How nice to meet someone with such pleasant manners. Do come again when you need to shout at someone smaller than you!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I was just checking out the landscape." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Hope you like it. I do enjoy the solitude of my little home. If you get time, please say hi to my friends in the Dwarven Mine." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Dwarven Mine?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Yep, the entrance is in the side of Ice Mountain just to the east of here. They're a friendly bunch. Stop in at Nurmof's store and buy one of my pickaxes!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Will do!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What do you make here?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "I make pickaxes. I am the best maker of pickaxes in the whole of Gielinor." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you have any to sell?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Sorry, but I've got a running order with Nurmof." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Who's Nurmof?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Nurmof has a store over in the Dwarven Mine. You can find the entrance on the side of Ice Mountain to the east of here." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ah, fair enough." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Hey, who said you could use that? My anvils get enough work with my own use. I make pickaxes, and it takes a lot of hard work." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry, would it be OK if I used your anvils?" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "If you could get me some more materials then I could let you use them." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I didn't want to use your anvils anyway." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "That is your choice." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Have you got my materials yet, traveller?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry, I don't have them all yet." },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Not to worry, stick at it. Remember, I need 6 clay, 4 copper ore, and 2 iron ore." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have everything you need!" },
    { "character": "Doric", "line": "Many thanks! Pass them here, please. I can spare you some coins for your trouble, and please use my anvils any time you want." }
