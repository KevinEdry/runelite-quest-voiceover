    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "Nettle for preference. Just make sure it's hot." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what is it you need?" },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "A bucket of milk with chocolate ground into it, with a handful of snape grass thrown in on top." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What? Run that past me again?" },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "Take a bucket of milk, a bar of chocolate and some snape grass." },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "Grind the chocolate with a mortar and pestle." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hey! I remember it now, ok! See you in a bit." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Why do they call you Skippy?" },

    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "A Mogre!" },

    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "A Mogre is a type of Ogre that spends most of its time underwater." },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "They hunt giant mudskippers by wearing their skins and swimming close until they can attack them." },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "When I used the Fishing Explosive I scared off all the fish, and so the Mogre got out of the water to express its extreme displeasure." },
    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "With an iron mace." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I take it the head injury is responsible for the staggering and yelling?" },

    { "character": "Skippy", "line": "My addiction to almost-lethal alcohol did that." },
