    { "character": "Player", "line": "Aha, sounds like a quest. I'll help." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Yes yes, I suppose it is a quest. My fiance Ernest and I came upon this house." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Seeing as we were a little lost Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "That was an hour ago. That house looks spooky, can you go and see if you can find him for me?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll see what I can do." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Thank you, thank you. I'm very grateful." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, I'm looking for something to kill." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Oooh, you violent person you." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Have you found my sweetheart yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, not yet." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Be careful in here, there's lots of dangerous equipment." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm looking for a guy called Ernest." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Ah Ernest, top notch bloke. He's helping me with my experiments." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So you know where he is then?" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "He's that chicken over there." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ernest is a chicken...? Are you sure?" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Oh, he isn't normally a chicken, or at least he wasn't until he helped me test my pouletmorph machine." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "It was originally going to be called a transmutation machine. But after testing pouletmorph seems more appropriate." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm glad Veronica didn't actually get engaged to a chicken." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Who's Veronica?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ernest's fiancee. She probably doesn't want to marry a chicken." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Ooh I dunno. She could have free eggs for breakfast." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I think you'd better change him back." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Umm... It's not so easy..." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "My machine is broken, and the house gremlins have run off with some vital bits." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well I can look for them." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "That would be a help. They'll be somewhere in the manor house or its grounds, the gremlins never get further than the entrance gate." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "I'm missing the pressure gauge and a rubber tube. They've also taken my oil can, which I'm going to need to get this thing started again." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Change him back this instant!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What does this machine do?" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Nothing at the moment... It's broken. It's meant to be a transmutation machine." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "It has also spent time as a time travel machine, and a dramatic lightning generator, and a thing for generating monsters." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Is this your house?" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "No, I'm just one of the tenants. It belongs to the count who lives in the basement." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes, he's a chicken." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "I know he's not exactly brave but I think you're being a bit harsh." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No no, he's been turned into an actual chicken by a mad scientist." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Eeeeeek!" },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "My poor darling, why must these things happen to us." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well I'm doing my best to turn him back." },
    { "character": "Veronica", "line": "Well be quick, I'm sure being a chicken can't be good for him." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Have you found anything yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm afraid I don't have any of them yet!" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "I need a rubber tube, a pressure gauge and a can of oil. Then your friend can stop being a chicken." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "There seems to be a pressure gauge in here..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ow!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "... and a lot of piranhas! I can't get the gauge out." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "... and a lot of dead fish." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "It's full of dead fish!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't think I want to use that water any more." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've only got the pressure gauge so far." },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "It's a good start, but I'll need my oil can and rubber tube too." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll go and look for them." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have everything!" },
    { "character": "Professor Oddenstein", "line": "Give 'em here then." },
    { "character": "Ernest", "line": "Thank you. It was dreadfully irritating being a chicken. How can I ever thank you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well a cash reward is always nice..." },
    { "character": "Ernest", "line": "Of course, of course." }
