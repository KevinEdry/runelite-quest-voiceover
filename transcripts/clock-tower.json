    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right, gotcha. I'll do that then." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've placed a cog!" },

    { "character": "Brother Kojo", "line": "The townsfolk will all be able to know the correct time now! Thank you so much for all of your help! And as promised, here is your reward!" }
