    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "I am the leader of the White Knights of Falador. Why do you seek my audience?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I seek a quest." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Well, I need some spy work doing but it's quite dangerous. It will involve going into the Black Knights' fortress." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I laugh in the face of danger!" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Well that's good. Don't get too overconfident though." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "You've come along at just the right time actually. All of my knights are already known to the Black Knights." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Subtlety isn't exactly our strong point." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Can't you just take your White Knights' armour off? They wouldn't recognise you then!" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "I am afraid our charter prevents us using espionage in any form, that is the domain of the Temple Knights." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Temple Knights? Who are they?" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "That information is classified. I am forbidden to share it with outsiders." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So... what do you need doing?" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Well, the Black Knights have started making strange threats to us; demanding large amounts of money and land, and threatening to invade Falador if we don't pay them." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Now, NORMALLY this wouldn't be a problem..." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "But they claim to have a powerful new secret weapon." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to infiltrate their fortress, find out what their secret weapon is, and then sabotage it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll do my best." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Good luck! Let me know how you get on. Here's the dossier for the case, I've already given you the details." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Oh. You don't appear to have any room for the dossier in your inventory. Come back when you do." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, I'm not ready to do that." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Come see me again if you change your mind." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I go and cower in a corner at the first sign of danger!" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Err...." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Well." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "I... suppose spy work DOES involve a little hiding in corners." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh. I suppose I'll give it a go then." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't, I'm just looking around." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Ok. Please don't break anything." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "How's the mission going?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I haven't managed to find what the secret weapon is yet..." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Well, keep at it! Falador's future is at stake!" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Here's the dossier on the case." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Hey! You can't come in here! This is a high security military installation!" },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Well, this is the guards' entrance. I might be new here but I can tell you're not a guard." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "You're not even wearing proper guards uniform!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh pleeeaaase let me in!" },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Go away. You're getting annoying." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So what is this uniform?" },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Well you can see me wearing it. It's an iron chainbody and a medium bronze helm." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hmmm... I wonder if I can make that or get some in the local towns...." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "What was that you muttered?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh, nothing important!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh, sorry." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Don't let it happen again." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So who does it belong to?" },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "This fortress belongs to the order of Black Knights known as the Kinshra." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh. Okay, thanks." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Get lost. This is private property." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes, but I work here!" },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Hey! Get back on duty!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Uh..." },
    { "character": "Black Knight", "line": "Die intruder!" },
    { "character": "Black Knight Captain", "line": "So... how's the secret weapon coming along?" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "The invincibility potion is almost ready..." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "It's taken me FIVE YEARS, but it's almost ready." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "Greldo the Goblin here is just going to fetch the last ingredient for me." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "It's a specially grown cabbage grown by my cousin Helda who lives in Draynor Manor." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "The soil there is slightly magical and it gives the cabbages slight magical properties...." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "...not to merntion the trees!" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "Now remember Greldo, only a Draynor Manor cabbage will do! Don't get lazy and bring any old cabbage, THAT would ENTIRELY wreck the potion!" },
    { "character": "Greldo", "line": "Yeth, Mithreth." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've found out what the Black Knight's secret weapon is. It's a potion of invincibility." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "A potion of invincibility? That is grave news indeed. If you can sabotage it somehow, you will be very well paid." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So when I finish this mission for you can I be a white knight? Can I wear your armour too?" },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "I am afraid I cannot authorise you to become a white knight unless under a situation of dire circumstance. Assisting us on a freelance basis will be well worth your time however and you will have my personal gratitude." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I can't buy stuff with personal gratitude though..." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "There is of course also the financial recompense as I said." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok! I'll get on to sabotaging that potion." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "I wouldn't go in there if I were you. Those Black Knights are in an important meeting. They said they'd kill anyone who went in there!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay, I won't." },
    { "character": "Fortress Guard", "line": "Wise move." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't care. I'm going in anyway." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Why exactly would I want to do that?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'm not supposed to be HELPING the witch you know..." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "Where has Greldo got to with that magic cabbage!" },
    { "character": "Black Knight Captain", "line": "What's that noise?" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "Hopefully Greldo with the cabbage... yes, look here it co....NOOOOOoooo!" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "My potion!" },
    { "character": "Black Knight Captain", "line": "Oh boy, this doesn't look good!" },
    { "character": "Black Cat", "line": "Meow!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Looks like my work here is done. Seems like that's successfully sabotaged their little secret weapon plan." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "It's RUINED! All that work, FIVE years down the drain, who was it! I'll find them and when I do...." },
    { "character": "Black Knight Captain", "line": "Erm.. maybe we can save some of it?" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "SAVE some of it? Are you mad!? That cabbage was a normal cabbage, it spoilt the whole thing and now I have to start all over again!" },
    { "character": "Black Knight Captain", "line": "No need to... get upset... you're scaring the cat." },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "'The CAT'? She's not 'THE CAT'!" },
    { "character": "Witch", "line": "She's Maemi... aren't you dear...." },
    { "character": "Black Cat", "line": "Purrr...." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have ruined the Black Knights' invincibility potion. That should put a stop to your problem and an end to their little schemes." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Yes, we have just received a message from the Black Knights saying they withdraw their demands, which would seem to confirm your story." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Now I believe there was some talk of a cash reward..." },
    { "character": "Sir Amik Varze", "line": "Absolutely right. Please accept this reward." }
