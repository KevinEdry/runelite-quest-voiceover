    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Right then, sounds like we'd better get to work!" },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Now I'll be needing some liquid honey, some sulphuric broline." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "And then..." },

    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Look, I need all three reagents to test the plague sample." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Come back when you've got them." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Oh. You don't have any touch paper." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "I won't be able to help after all." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Seems like you don't actually have the plague sample." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "It's a long way to come empty handed." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "And quite a long way back too." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Now I'll just apply these to the sample and..." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "I don't get it... the touch paper has remained the same." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Well that's just it, nothing has happened." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "I don't know what this sample is." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "But it certainly isn't toxic." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "This result can only mean one thing... there is no plague." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "It seems that someone has been lying about all of it." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "The only question is... why?" },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Oh. Goodbye then." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "Well, hello traveller. I still can't understand why they would lie." },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "It's strange, anyway how are you doing?" },
    { "character": "Guidor", "line": "I'm hanging in there." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "You assume correctly, but where do you get such impertinence." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "A hoax? I've never heard such a ridiculous thing..." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Ah... I see. Well then you are right about the plague." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "But I did it for the good of my people." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "When it protects them from a far greater danger." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "A fear too big to fathom." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "When my father was king, he ruled over a united Ardougne." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "But on his deathbed, he could not decide which of his sons." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Should succeed him, so he had the city split into two." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "I became king of East Ardougne while my brother, Tyras, ruled over West." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "My brother was a good man and was great at many things." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Being a king was not one of them." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Rather than looking after his people, he went on numerous expeditions." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "To the lands west of here. On one of these expeditions, he was captured." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "By the forces of the Dark Lord." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "The Dark Lord agreed to spare his life, but only on one condition." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "That he would drink from the Chalice of Eternity." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "The chalice corrupted him." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "He joined forces with the Dark Lord, the embodiment of pure evil." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "And so I erected the wall, not just to protect my people." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "But to protect all the people of Gielinor." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Tyras is king of West Ardougne, sealing off the city was the only way." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "To stop him and the Dark Lord." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "I knew people would never believe the truth." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "So I had the plague made up as an excuse for the cordon." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "I'm not proud of it, but it was the only way to keep people safe." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "While my brother is still at large, I must ask that you keep this secret." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "We can't bring the wall down until we know he is no longer a danger." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "You're willing to help? Gods be praised!" },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "My brother is currently gathering strength in the lands to the west." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "If we are to stop him, we must find a way through the mountains." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "There is an underground pass that should lead through." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "But it is full of danger." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Return to me when you are ready to face this peril." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Until then, I give you permission to use my training area." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "It's located just to the north west of the city." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "I'll also let the mourners know that you are a friend to Ardougne." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "You will be allowed to pass through the gates whenever you please." },
    { "character": "King Lathas", "line": "Now, you'd better be off. You have much to prepare for." },
