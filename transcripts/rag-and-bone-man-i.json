    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I'm an archaeologist. I work with the museum." },

    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Yes." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well that explains the bones...sort of...but what are you doing all the way out here?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I'm collecting bones for the museum." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "They have asked me to rig up some displays of second and third age creatures using their bones, so that people can come and...well, look at them." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I need to get them into some sort of order before I begin, but I've run into a bit of a snag." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What sort of a snag?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Well, I need to have all the bones I'm going to use here, and placed into some sort of order." },

    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Sorting, yes, sorting these bones out ready for the museum, but I need a few more." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Will you help me out by grabbing some?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes. I'll give you a hand." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You will? Excellent!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where do you need me to dig?" },

    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Oh, you must have got the wrong end of the stick." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I need some fresh, whole bones to replace ones that have become damaged." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Err..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Excuse me..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry..." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Ok, got it." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Ok, here is the thing. While sorting out what bones I do have I managed to lose or damage a few. If you can get me some fresh, unbroken bones to use as replacements then I can get on with things." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "That make things clearer?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, it makes some sense I suppose..." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Great. If you can get me a bone from a Goblin, a Bear, a Big Frog, a Ram, a Unicorn, a Monkey, a Giant rat and a Giant Bat then I'll be able to move on with the..." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Displays..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So you just want me to bring you these bones and that will be that?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Well, I wouldn't mind you sticking them in a pot and boiling them in vinegar first, if you don't mind." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "There is a Wine Merchant in Draynor called Fortunato that sells the stuff you'll need." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You can even use my pot-boiler if you want." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Why do I need to boil them in vinegar?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "It gets them bright and sparking white." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "It's an archaeologist thing." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Just put the bone in a pot of vinegar, throw some logs on the fire, put the pot in the holder and light the logs." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "It takes a while for the vinegar to evaporate, but the bone will be nice and clean in the end." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "All right, I'll be back later." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Bye!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Oh...I see." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Well, never mind me young man, I'll just stagger over here under my massive burden, and continue my thankless task." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Wow, trying a guilt trip much?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well good luck with that!" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Thanks stranger!" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "What a polite young man..." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Well, back to work!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Where is that mumbling coming from?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "What mumbling?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Anyway, I have enough problems of my own without dealing with a delusional adventurer." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello there!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I was just passing and I wondered if you still needed someone to help with the bones?" },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Can I help you at all?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Have you got any vinegar?" },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Vinegar?" },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Vinegar!" },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "The very idea! My wines are the finest in the district!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sorry! I was told to come and speak with a wine merchant about getting some vinegar, I must have the wrong person." },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Wait...did HE send you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "If by HE you mean the old man with the sack of bones, then yes." },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Aaaah...say no more sir, I have some in specially." },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Ah! Good afternoon your lordship. I take it you have come for a refill?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not today." },
    { "character": "Fortunato", "line": "Well, just remember I have some in stock for you when you want it." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Have you brought me any bones?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not at the moment. Can you just give me a run down on which bones I have left to get?" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Sure." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Goblin bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Goblins are relatively common. I hear there is a house full of them around Lumbridge in fact." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Bear bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I heard that there are some Bears over by the Legends' Guild, near Ardougne." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Big Frog bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "This might be a little tricky as you will need to go into the Lumbridge Swamp caves. You will need a light source! Never forget your light source down there!" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Ram bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I'm sure you will be able to find a ram wherever there are sheep." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Unicorn bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I seem to remember that there were Unicorns south of Varrock, I think they might be there still." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Monkey bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Monkeys tend to live in Jungle areas, like Karamja. I think they are pretty plentiful there if I remember correctly." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Giant Rat bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "If you can't find one in a sewer, then you might want to try looking in some caves." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "You still need to bring me a Giant Bat bone." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Giant bats tend to live underground, but I have heard there are a few near the Coal Pits." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Did you get all that?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Yes. I'll get right on it." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Don't forget to boil them in vinegar first." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Just chuck some logs into the pit, put the bone in the pot of vinegar and drop it onto the pot-boiler. Then light the logs and wait for the the vinegar to boil away." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Ok, I'll remember." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I have some bones for you." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Great! Let me take a look at them." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Wonderful! I'll put this with the rest." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No problem. I'll be back if I find some more." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Great! Just clean them up in the pot-boiler and hand them over." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "That's the last of them!" },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "The museum will be thrilled to know I've completed the collection." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well I'm just glad I could help." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "Well you've been a big help and no mistake." },
    { "character": "Odd Old Man", "line": "I'm always on the lookout for fresh bones, so if you see some bring them right over." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No problem, I'll be sure to bring anything you might like over if I find something." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I can't wait to see the displays once they are finished." }
