    { "character": "Player", "line": "Of course. Tell me what happened." },

    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Some of General Khazard's men spotted us and offered to help, but they demanded my husband and son fight in their arena first! We said no, but they took them anyway!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "General Khazard?" },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "He's a menace! This entire area is under the control of him and his mercenary group, the Khazard Army. They prey on the weak and vulnerable, making them fight in that arena of theirs, all for entertainment!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's horrible! How are they able to get away with it?" },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "The authorities don't care. Khazard's men just pay them off if they ever come to investigate." },

    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Thank you. They'll be somewhere inside the arena. I'll be waiting here for you." },

    { "character": "Joe", "line": "I've heard of them, but if your hope is to help them, I fear you may be too late." },
    { "character": "Kelvin", "line": "You should leave while you can. If the guards get you, you'll be in here next." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "No one important. I'm looking for the Servil family." },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "I've seen them in here, but my advice to you is to leave them. Whatever plan you have will only end with you in a cell as well." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Just checking if you have any orders for me." },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Not right now. Things are all very boring at the moment. What I'd give to be over at the bar having a nice Khali brew..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Khali brew? Can't say I've ever had one." },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Oh, nothing beats them! Mind you, don't make the mistake of having too many. Last time I did, I ended up falling straight to sleep." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Good to know, thanks." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Hello again." },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "What a boring day. You'd think the slaves would be more entertaining." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not long now until you get a break though, right?" },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Too right! Then it's straight to the bar for a nice Khali brew." },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Do you still fancy a drink?" },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "I really shouldn't..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Are you sure?" },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Oh... okay then, but just the one." },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "That is some gooood stuff... yeah... wooh, yeah!" },

    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Yeesshh! Oooh, maybe I sshould relax for a while." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Good idea. I'll look after the prisoners." },
    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Yeesh... that shounds reasonable. Here, take the keysch. Any trouble, you give... you give 'em a good beating." },

    { "character": "Head Guard", "line": "Pleash... leave me alone. Did the walls always shway soooo much?" },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "We'll need to wait for the guards to change shift, but don't worry, you'll be out soon..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright, the coast is clear." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Now, let's get you out of here." },

    { "character": "Sammy Servil", "line": "Quick, help him!" },

    { "character": "Player", "line": "Lady Servil, I freed your son, but he went to help your husband." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "No! Please, you have to help them!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Well, well, well, you seem to be in quite the rush. Do you have somewhere else to be?" },
    { "character": "Sammy Servil", "line": "Oh no..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "General Khazard, I presume?" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "You presume correct. I must say, I sense a great air of defiance to you. Does my appearance not fill you with fear?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I've seen worse." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "How arrogant. No matter though, you will come to learn." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Now, despite your entertaining show, the two individuals you are attempting to leave with are my property." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "They belong to nobody!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Ha! Well if their freedom is so valuable to you, how about a trade? Fight in my arena, and if you win, I'll let them go." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "And what if I refuse your offer?" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Well... I wasn't actually giving you a choice. Guards, take them to the cells." },
    { "character": "Spectator", "line": "Hey, you're the one from the arena! That was some great fighting!" },
    { "character": "Door Guard", "line": "So you're back for more are you? General Khazard will be pleased." },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "Hello there. So Khazard got his hands on you too?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Unfortunately so." },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "Well if you're lucky, you might last as long as me." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "How long have you been here?" },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "As long as I can remember. I was a child when his men kidnapped me. My whole life has been spent killing and fighting, all in the hope that one day I might escape." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Don't give up." },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "Thanks, friend." },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "Wait... sounds like the guard is coming. Looks like you'll be going back into the arena. Good luck, friend." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Now watch closely, friends. I fear this may be where your protector dies." },
    { "character": "Justin Servil", "line": "Ignore him! You can do it!" },
    { "character": "Hengrad", "line": "I don't know how you managed to escape, but you may not be as lucky next time. Get out of here while you can." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Impressive, but now for a proper challenge. Time for my puppy. Bring on Bouncer!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Bouncer! No!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "You monster! You'll pay for what you've done!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I only did what you asked. I fought in your arena. Now let the Servils go." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Fine! I am not a coward who makes false promises. I have no need of them anyway. You on the other hand, won't be going anywhere." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Guard, escort the Servils out. I'll take great pleasure in dealing with this one myself!" },
    { "character": "Sammy Servil", "line": "Don't try to fight him! Just run!" },
    { "character": "Khazard Guard", "line": "You! You're the one who killed Bouncer." },
    { "character": "Khazard Guard", "line": "Die you monster!" },
    { "character": "Spectator", "line": "Hey, you're the one who beat Bouncer! Amazing!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Going somewhere?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "But... I killed you!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Ha! Arrogant fool! You think you can kill me? I am General Khazard! My power is absolute!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Now, part of me would very much like to kill you for what you've done today, but let it be known that I am not without generosity." },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "You proved yourself in battle against me. That is something few can boast of. For that, you may leave. However, if you ever oppose me again, I won't hesitate to wipe you from existence!" },
    { "character": "General Khazard", "line": "Now go. I have business to attend to elsewhere that is far more important than you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Lady Servil." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "You're alive! I feared General Khazard would have killed you!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He tried, but I escaped." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Thank goodness. I'd have never forgiven myself if you'd have died saving my family." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Now, you'll be pleased to know that my son and husband are safe and recovering at home. Without you they would certainly be dead. Thank you, for everything." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "It's not a problem." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Please, take this payment. It's the least you deserve." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "He tried, but I was able to defeat him." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "You killed General Khazard?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I thought I had at first, but it seems he is not that easy to kill." },
    { "character": "Lady Servil", "line": "Well, at least you're alive." }
