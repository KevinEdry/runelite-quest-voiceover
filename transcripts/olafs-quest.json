    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Get lost, outlander! I've no time for you!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Who is that? Identify yourself!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "It's me. What are you doing out here?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Nothing... Just carving these horribly broken pieces of driftwood." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "In the middle of nowhere." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "In damp clothing." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, have a nice day." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Wait! Would you do me a favour?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "What kind of a favour?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Look, you see that heap of driftwood over there? That is my ship, and all that is left of my one shot at making my ancestors proud of me." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "My family have always been great explorers and seafarers, and I recently set off on my maiden voyage." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "However, a big storm - yes, a huge storm in fact - blew my ship onto the rocks. Three times." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I've been sitting here ever since, trying to think of a way to make my family proud, and if you will help me...I think I have a way." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Okay, I'll help you out." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Thank you! I don't have much apart from my carvings, some driftwood and the map that I was following when I had my little..." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "...accident." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "If you help me out, then I'll gladly hand it over." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "So, what is your plan?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, I have a little food left, although it's a little briny." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "If you take a couple of carvings to my wife and son in the village over the hill and tell them that I sent you with them from a distant island, then I can wait out here for a week or so before returning." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright, hand me over the carvings and I'll be on my way." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, none of these are any good. I'll need some fresh wood from a decent tree." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "When I was swimming for my life I saw an odd-looking windswept tree to the east of here, up that cliff." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Could you bring me some of that wood so I can work it?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Wow, you must have pretty good eyes to be able to see a single tree from the water during a heavy storm." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Yes...great eyes...they run in the family." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Possibly later, when you don't smell so damp." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Bah! Well, if you aren't going to help, do me a favour and jump off that cliff!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "So... Got the logs for me yet?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not yet. I just popped back to see how you were doing." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Still cold. Still damp. 'Bout average, really." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Olaf, I cut some logs from the tree. Here's the wood." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Wonderful! I'll carve them up now." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Done!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "That's it?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Yep!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "This is for my wife, Ingrid. I'm sure she will love it. Tell her it's tribal or something." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Sure..." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "And this one is for my son, Volf. Kids love planks in my experience. Tell him I said hello." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Alright. They live in Rellekka, right?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Yes. Hurry back! And don't forget the story: I'm not here, I'm someplace far away." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "So, how did my wife like her carving?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I don't know... I've still got it." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, hurry up and give it to her then!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "She was very happy with it!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Wonderful!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I wish I could see her again..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, if this plan works out you will be able too, right?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Yes, you're right." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Did my son like his present? I'll bet he was thrilled." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I'll bet he will be... but I've still got it." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, take your time over it, why don't you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Excuse me, but are you Ingrid? The same Ingrid that is married to Olaf Hradson?" },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "Yes I am. Why do you ask?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I am a friend of your husband. He sent me here with a gift for you." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "An expensive, exotic gift from the far-flung and tropical shores of the Island of Obscurity." },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "How wonderful! I assumed from the way the big oaf always referred to the rigging as 'big strings' that he couldn't navigate his way out of a soggy paper bag. So, can I see the gift he sent?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Certainly! Here it is. He sends his best wishes along with it." },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "I see. It looks like a log with 'Olaf was here' carved in it." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "It's tribal! Very tribal! I watched the natives carve it myself." },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "Well, since you have come such a long way, you can have this. I baked it this morning, so it's still nice and fresh." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Oh, thank you! Enjoy your Obscurian Tribal Artefact(tm). It has a million-and-one uses!" },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "Hello again! Have you any word from my husband?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Err, no, not yet. It takes a while for the messages to reach me, you know." },
    { "character": "Ingrid Hradson", "line": "Well, when you do, tell him we'll be more than happy to see him again." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Volf? Son of Olaf Hradson?" },
    { "character": "Volf Olafson", "line": "Yes. Do I know you?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "No, but I do know your father. He sent me with a present for you from, err..." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "From the Island of Obscurity." },
    { "character": "Volf Olafson", "line": "Oh! That was fast! He only set off recently, and I was wondering how he was doing. So, where is this gift?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Right here. Enjoy!" },
    { "character": "Volf Olafson", "line": "What is it?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Very valuable. Have a nice time!" },
    { "character": "Volf Olafson", "line": "Wait! Here, take this. I was going to have it for my lunch, but I suppose you can have it in payment." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Thanks! Enjoy your new...thing!" },
    { "character": "Volf Olafson", "line": "Hello again! Does my father send any word...or treasures like before?" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not today, but if he does, you will be the first to know." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Olaf, are you all right?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "So...cold...need...fire." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "I delivered your carvings as you asked. Your family would like to see you again." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Here, let me get you to the village before you freeze to death." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I won't...go...anywhere. I don't...care if I...freeze." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I'd rather...die...than suffer...the shame." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Just get the...fire burning. Use...these." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, at least give me the map like you promised!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Too...cold...to...hear...whining." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "So...very...cold. Almost cold enough to tear up an old map with my fevered shivering. Cough, cough." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Ahhhhhhhh... Much better." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, I'm glad you're happy. Can I have that map now?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, okay...but could I have a little of that food first? I've had nothing but seaweed and biscuits for the past week." },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Not a chance." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Okay, okay, I was only asking." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Well, regardless, you've more than earned this map. It was the last one my grandfather, Sven the Helmsman, ever made." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "It is supposed to show the location of one of his stashes of treasure, but I have never been able to decipher the strange, runic inscriptions that point the way." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I wish you luck!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Well, thanks. What will you do now?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "I'll sit here and practice carving." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "If you pass this way again, I'll be glad if you drop my next load of work off with my family." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "That or bring me some food before I starve. Whichever." },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "Hey! I'm trying to carve and you're standing in my light! Move it!" },
    { "character": "Player", "line": "Olaf, I seem to have lost your map, can I have another?" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "You lost the treasured map of Sven the Helmsman? How dare you!" },
    { "character": "Olaf Hradson", "line": "You'd best take better care of this one, or else!" },
